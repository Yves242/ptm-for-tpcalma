## About
This repository is established and managed by John Yves Baltazar, a dedicated peer tutor committed to supporting fellow computer science students. The primary objective is to create a repository serving as a comprehensive reference for you. It is designed to be a valuable container for the code samples discussed during our tutoring sessions, providing a reliable resource to reinforce your understanding of various topics even when you're outside the peer tutoring environment.

## Code Samples
Explore the `codes` directory to find examples related to various concepts and programming languages. This directory contains the files that were used during our tutoring sessions, serving as a valuable reference for you. Feel free to review and study these materials to reinforce your understanding of the topics covered in our sessions.

## Contact
If you have follow-up questions or need additional clarification, feel free to reach out to me on my [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/yvesbaltazar). I'm happy to assist with any queries you may have.

For more in-depth discussions or if you prefer face-to-face sessions, let's schedule a session at a mutually convenient time by filling this [google form](https://bit.ly/LRCPEERTutorials-Cluster5) again. This is important for formal documentation. **Do not directly register via Koalendar link without filling the google form!**
